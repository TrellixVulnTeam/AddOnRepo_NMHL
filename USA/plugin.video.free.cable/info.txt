There was a change ...

This add-on is no longer being developed. Both the stable and unstable (BETA) are not available anymore. "Free Cable" was renamed to "[B]USTV VoD[/B] (Video-on-Demand)".

Please uninstall the mentioned add-ons and install the new USTV VoD Add-On you can find in the [B]xbmcplus repository[/B].

A lot of new features have been added to USTV VoD recently. Most of your questions should be answered after a read through @forum.xbmc.org.

Sincerely yours
xbmcplus devs
