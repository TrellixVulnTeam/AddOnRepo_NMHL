  	<description>Fixes the "please wait" freeze/lockup when Navi-X 3.7.8 cant connect to its 
servers. It enables the smartcaching feature to access previously visited pages.
This fix can be undone by rerunning this program and clicking undo to put the original files back.
There is also a Gotham fix for the XML file to allow Navi-X to run in Gotham
